"fake" 3x3 (corner) bricks:
=============================
c2duo:		~5 ms per brick
hogwarts:	8-20 ms per brick, runtime seems to vary, first run was best (8-10 ms per brick)
		     	    	   could this be memory issues, e.g. fragmentation of memory?
pepparkakehus:  38-43 ms per brick, runtime seems stable
datorbebis:     40-52 ms per brick first run, 39-44 ms all subsequent runs - OTP R16B01
                                   seems to be an Erlang VM issue as this is not seen with OTP R17
                                   on comparable HW

conclusion: hogwarts and c2duo are naturally faster, but around 40 ms per brick on a RPi is pretty
            fast as well. Even if this is a small sample, it gave pretty good/stable numbers/an
	    indication of magnitude.

	    With these runtimes, the big puzzle should be solved in no time once it's clusterified.
	    It seems, the chunks are "lagom" for distribution and the cluster server should "tick
	    through" the chunks pretty fast. The only disadvantage with that is that the server
	    might get too busy, so it cannot scale when the amout of workers grows. Also, the
	    percentage of network communication time in the total runtime is expected to be non-
	    negligible. However, a slower solver would only mean a larger total runtime

	    The instability in the runtime on the Radxa Rock is upsetting/disconcerning. Could be
	    worth looking into RAM usage and flash access times, although there shouldn't be much
	    file system interaction.

            On all machines, the first brick was always the fastest and the last the slowest, which
	    suggests that bricks show strong individual runtime properties, even if the search
	    itself is exhaustive (i.e. it will always check all dead ends).
